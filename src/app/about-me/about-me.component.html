        My name is Noah and I enjoy designing and building stuffs that live on the internet.
  
        My interest in coding started back in 2018 when I decided to write a program that prints <span class="text-yellow-400">"hello world"</span> in C â€” turns out 
        telling the computer what to do really and then doing exactly thesame thing got me fascinated. <br><br>
  
        Today, having worked at some awesome start-ups, ranging from different industries and teams is a privilege
         I've enjoyed. <br> <br> These days, I spend much of my time 
        at Multilent Softwares creating digital 
        experiences and solutions that are inclusive and accessible for a range of clients.
  
        As a software engineer, I specialize in building incredible digital experiences, 
        as well as occasionally designing them. I'm now focusing on 
        building products that are accessible and put the user first.
