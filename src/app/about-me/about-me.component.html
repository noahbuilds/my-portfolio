      My name is Noah and I enjoy designing and building stuffs that live on the
      internet. My interest in coding started back in 2018 when I wrote a
      program that prints <span class="text-yellow-400">"hello world"</span> in
      C — turns out telling the computer what to do and then doing exactly
      thesame thing got me really fascinated🤯. <br /><br />

      Today, having worked at some awesome start-ups, ranging from different
      industries and teams is a privilege I've enjoyed. <br />
      <br />
      These days, I spend much of my time building awesome digital products and
      solutions that are inclusive and accessible for a range of clients. <br> 
      As a software engineer, I specialize in building incredible digital
      experiences, as well as occasionally designing them. 
      <!-- I'm now focusing on building products that are accessible and put the user first.  -->

      Aside sitting in front back of my machine👩‍💻. I love playing video games 🎮, drumming🥁 and consuming Shawarma with Ice-cream😋
